Guess the number game
In this example, we will get to use the input scanner to build a guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1-100, and the user gets 10 guesses to find out what that number is.
When the game first starts it prints a few sentences explaining what's going on:
Then asks the user to guess the number. Once the user types in a number and hits enter, the game will compare that guessed number with the random number it had generated and tell the user if it's smaller or larger, then they get to guess again.
If the user manages to guess the number before they run out of guesses they win. Otherwise they lose!
